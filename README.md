<h1>**added features to the Hungry Animal Assignment**</h1>

- Addition of the *Peanut* class: just as the elephant eats an apple to increase the score, eating a peanut decreases the score
- Instead of showing only the value of the score while playing the game (in the *MyWorld* world), I added “Score: “ before the value
- In the original tutorial, when the elephant fails to eat an apple, this results in the game being over. I adjusted this to make the game end in either of two scenarios: 1. Where the elephant misses 3 apples in a row. 2. If the score ever gets below 0.
- After changing the background screen of the “TitleScreen” world to a space theme, I also made a “GameoverWorld” world where the background screen is the same as the “TitleScreen” world, and this “GameoverWorld” is the screen that shows up when the game ends, instead of just having the words “Game Over” show up on the “MyWorld” world.
- Finally, I added the feature of being able to press <space> in the “GameoverWorld” world to replay the game, instead of having to rerun the program.
